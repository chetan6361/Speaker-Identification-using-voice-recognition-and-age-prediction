# Speaker-Identification-using-voice-recognition-and-age-prediction

This study focuses on developing a voice recognition system that accurately identifies speakers and predicts their age using audio data. The system utilizes Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to extract essential features from voice recordings, capturing unique vocal characteristics. For speaker identification, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are employed, leveraging their ability to model the probabilistic distribution of voice features effectively. Additionally, a Random Forest (RF) model is used for age prediction, analyzing the same features to estimate a speakerâ€™s age based on their vocal attributes. The system is designed to handle real-world challenges, including background noise and voice variability over time and across different communication channels.

Note: The actual training data for speaker identification (trainingData) and age prediction (cv-valid-test) are not fully uploaded because of the file size.
